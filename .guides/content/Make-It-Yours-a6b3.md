### 🖼️ Using Your Own Sprite

1. Find an image that's **at least 80×80 pixels**
2. Open **[Squoosh](https://squoosh.app)**, resize to about 80×80, and download *(Squoosh can make images smaller but not larger — start with a big enough image!)*
3. Upload the file to your `images/` folder in Codio
4. Update the `Actor('name')` in your code to match the filename (no `.png`)

Now customize `explore.py`:

1. **Swap a sprite** — replace `happy`, `alien`, or `cookie` with your own image
2. **Change the background** — try `screen.fill((r, g, b))` with different color values
3. **Adjust a speed** — find where speeds are set and try different numbers
