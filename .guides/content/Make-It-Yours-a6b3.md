### 🖼️ Using Your Own Sprite

*Use these steps any time you want a custom image in your game.*

1. Find an image that's **at least 80×80 pixels** — photos and illustrations work; tiny icons usually don't
2. Open **[Squoosh](https://squoosh.app)** on your computer, resize to about 80×80, and download *(Squoosh can make images smaller but not bigger — always start with a large enough image)*
3. Upload the resized file to your `images/` folder in Codio
4. Change the `Actor` name in your code to match the filename — no extension needed
