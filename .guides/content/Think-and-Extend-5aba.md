## Think and Reflect

**In your own words:** What do `draw()` and `update()` each do? Why are they separate functions?

## Extend

**Want to go further?**

Try adding a second collectible to `explore.py`. You'll need to:

1. Create a second `Actor` at the top (e.g., `cookie2 = Actor('cookie')`)
2. Set its starting position
3. Draw it in `draw()`
4. Check for collision in `update()` and move it when collected

1. **Watch the videos** on the File Structure and Make It Yours pages
2. **Play the game** on the Explore a Game page
3. **Read through** explore.py and match the code to the three sections (Actors, draw, update)
