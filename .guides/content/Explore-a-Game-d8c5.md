## Explore a Game

Hit **Run** in the terminal to start the game. Use the arrow keys to move the happy face.

**Play for a minute, then answer these questions:**

- What happens when you collect a cookie?
- What ends the game?
- Look at the code — can you find where the alien moves?

> *[TODO: insert free-text-auto assessment — "What does this game do? Describe at least two things you noticed in the code."]*

Don't worry about understanding every line yet. Just get a feel for what's possible.
